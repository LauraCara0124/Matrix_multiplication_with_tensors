#Matrix_multiplication_with_tensors
- Tensors: The 93 tensors in text files
- Algorithm_rxsxt_Thresholds: Program that returns the times of the tensor algorithm, the ordinary algorithm and the optimal tensor algorithm for several powers of a chosen tensor
-  RandomMatrixAdded zeros: returns the needed zeros to add to the chosen matrices for each tensor.
- FinalProgram: Computes the multiplication  of two given matrices and returns the time for the ordinary method and the tensor's algorithm.
- RandomMatrix: Creates two files with random matrices of the chosen sizes.
